## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This package is code for assisting users to create SSH identityfile and key in RsyncUI. The user can either let RsyncUI assist in creating SSH identityfile and key in RsyncUI, or create it by commandline.

The package is used in [version 2.1.1 and later](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncUI) of RsyncUI.

By Using Swift Package Manager (SPM), parts of the source code in RsyncUI is extraced and created as packages. The old code, the base for packages, is deleted and RsyncUI imports the new packages.  

In Xcode 16 there is also a new module, Swift Testing, for testing packages.By SPM and Swift Testing, the code for RsyncUI is modularized, isolated, and tested before committing changes.
